This is just a place for me to store code I'm playing with for now.

What's here initally are my Sudoku app for android, the MVC help project for it and my work in progress Casino games app.

If you happen by here by some search or something I'd appreciate it if you didn't lift my code. If you're just looking for examples of how to use lib-gdx or something, feel free to poke around and see how I figured it out.

I make no claims that any of this code it pretty or proper.
